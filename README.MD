# Google Volley With Apache4 (4.4.1.2)

This is an unofficial mirror of [Google's Volley project](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/) for Android.
Since the current master code contains references to the legacy apache library, I've update the code to use the an [apache httpclient port
for Android maintained by Marek Sebera](https://github.com/smarek/httpclient-android/wiki/Project-Introduction). Since this port 
is [mentioned on Apache's website](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/android-port.html), I can only assume it's 
atleast recognized by the Apache Foundation.

You can take a look at the [example project](https://github.com/alphamu/GoogleVolleyWithApache4Example) I've done using this library.
